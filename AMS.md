### General Formatting
 AtlasCorporations Manual Style is like Chicago style but has a couple quirks that I think make it a bit easier to understand and use for manual formatting. Firstly, the default font should be Lato. If Lato is not available, the font should be an easy-to-read sans-serif font like Times New Roman, Liberation, or Arial. For users that have dyslexia use OpenDyslexic. All should be double-spaced. If something is not specified the defaults are Lato font, black color, 12 size font and left justified.

### Cover Page
 In the header should be at minimal a page number and at maximum a document name and the page number. Your cover page should have an obvious title using a large size or bolded font while following the general rules and centered. At the bottom of the page should be the author’s name, then the company that you are writing for or sending it to, then the current date all centered. A picture can be included under the title usually a logo.

### Titles, Headings, and Subheadings
 Titles, Headings, and Subheading are like each other in this style. All should be in a blue font and underlined. A title style is only used in the title of the document. A title should be centered in at least 18 font size and bolded. Headings should be centered in at least 16 font size. Subheadings should be left justified in at least 14 font size.

### Table of Contents
 The Table of Contents should be on the page after the cover page. The Table of Contents header should be a heading but left justified. The content should be in the default style with the page number being right justified. The listing style should be a multilevel list style like below.

##### Table of Contents Example
```text
Chapter 1 -------------------------------------------------------- 1
Chapter 2 -------------------------------------------------------- 2
````

### Paragraphs
 Paragraphs should be indented using a tab before the first sentence and using the default style.

### Quotes
 Quotes should be in the default style surrounded by the double quotation marks with single quotation marks being used inside a quote. Quote should be italicized if take directly out of a piece of text. If it is a quote of more than four sentences it is considered a blockquote and should be centered. Brendan Beard is quoted as saying, “_We are the creators of future!_” This is an example of a direct quote. On the AtlasCorporations website it states,

 “_AtlasCorporations is committed to creating the future as it says in our motto. We do this by creating video games, online tools, and other immersive technology to help with everyday life, your entertainment, and scientific research. The idea of AtlasCorporations was founded in 2016 by Brendan Beard. He started by creating Scratch games and soon moved on to the programming language Python which in turn created the AtlasCorporations you know and love._”

Blockquotes are a little different as seen above. Each line should be indented with the other rules still applying.

### Numbering/Lists
 Numbering and lists are simple. Ordered lists should be formatted in numerical order with a period placed after the number and a space placed after the period. Unordered lists should use the dot/dash style. Dot for a major item and dash for a minor item. If these are already used use a different style of dots or dashes. You should never use a multilevel list unless it is the Table of Contents.

### Footnotes/Endnotes
 Footnotes in are flexible in this style. Footnotes should be used to describe an acronym or a piece of information in more detail in concise fashion. The footnote number should go after the sentence that needs the footnote in superscript. Footnotes should go at the bottom of the page with superscripted numbers beginning the information.[^1] Footnotes should not contain links and instead should have the author’s last name or company name and then a colon to replace the link. Links go under the Works Cited/Reference’s area which will be talked about later. Endnotes follow this style.
 
 [^1]: Merriam-Webster: This describes that a footnote is defined as a note of reference, explanation, or comment usually placed below the text on a printed page.

### Works Cited/References/Sources
 A works cited page or similar pages should be its own page formatted, {Last}, {First Initial}: “{Title}”; {Published}; {Date Accessed}; {Link}. Links are only required for websites. The sources should be cited in first appearance style. Numbering style is flexible.
